# belly-button-challenge
For this project, I used JavaScript, d3, Plotly, and HTML to build a dashboard for visualizing the results of a study that catalogs the microbes which colonize the human navel (belly button). Each person, or sample, that participated in the study was assigned an ID. There's a dropdown on the dashboard which allows you to select a sample ID, and then then the table and charts are populated with that samples information. The demographic table provides information about the person who provided the sample. The "Most Prevlanet Bacteria" chart shows the 10 most prevalent operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and their values for any given sample. Finally, the "Biodiversity Visualization" uses size and color coded bubbles to help visualizae the breakdown of microbes that inhabit the samples belly button. In this chart, bubble size is determined by OTU value, while bubble color is determined by OTU ID. Please download this repository and launch the "index.html" file using Live Server to view/use this dashboard.
